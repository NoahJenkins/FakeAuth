![FakeAuth Logo](./assets/logo/FakeAuth_med.png "FakeAuth - for simple oAuth .NET 6 development")

a .NET Core library to make developing offline for OAuth and OIDC much easier. 

Developing with OAuth or OIDC - takes about 30 minutes of set up work just to get going; with FakeAuth, it's one line of code.  

Supports custom Claims and Profiles that can be swapped in during development of your application. 

Examples in the [Samples Folder](https://github.com/calebjenkins/FakeAuth/tree/main/Samples).  More details on [why this was built on this blog post](https://developingux.com/introducing-fakeauth/) and [additional articles](https://developingux.com/fakeauth). 

### Installing FakeAuth

You should install [FakeAuth with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FakeAuth):

    Install-Package FakeAuth
    
Or via the .NET Core command line interface:

    dotnet add package FakeAuth

Either command, from Package Manager Console or .NET Core CLI, will download and install FakeAuth and all required dependencies.

### Using FakeAuth

In an ASP.NET Core Application, you can configure FakeAuth in the Startup Class:

   services.AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth();

That will give you a default profile. In fact, the above is exactly the same as doing this:

   services.AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth<DefaultProfile>();

You can create custom profiles by implementing the interface [IFakeAuthProfile](https://github.com/calebjenkins/FakeAuth/blob/main/src/FakeAuth/Profiles/IFakeAuthProfile.cs),
or you can inline your custom claims directly:

```csharp
  services.AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth((options) =>
    {
		options.Claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "Fake User"));
		options.Claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Expense_Approver"));
		options.Claims.Add(new Claim("Approval_Limit", "25.00"));
		options.Claims.Add(new Claim("Approval_Currency", "USD"));
		options.Claims.Add(new Claim("Preffered_Location", "Disney Island"));
	});
```
See more of these examples in the [SampleWeb application](https://github.com/calebjenkins/FakeAuth/tree/main/Samples/FakeAuth.SampleWeb).

### Testing with FakeAuth

FakeAuth works great with ASP.Net's testing framework. For some examples, take a look at the
[FakeAuth.IntegrationTests project](https://github.com/calebjenkins/FakeAuth/blob/main/Tests/FakeAuth.IntegrationTests).

In particular, you can set the FakeAuth claims for a specific `HttpClient` using `SetFakeAuthClaims(...)`:

```csharp
client.SetFakeAuthClaims(
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "Joe Manager"),
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Manager")
);
```

You can also re-use any profiles that implement `IFakeAuthProfile` directly on your `HttpClient`:
```csharp
 client.SetFakeAuthClaims<DefaultProfile>();
```

This lets you write tests that validate your authorization works as intended with and without the required claims.

### .NET 6

In .NET 6 you are no longer required to use a StartUp class. You can still use FakeAuth directly in the [Program class](https://github.com/calebjenkins/FakeAuth/blob/main/Samples/nuget.SampleWeb6.0/Program.cs):

```csharp
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth();
```

### Use Cases - for OAuth/Claims based .NET Core applications

- To get started building your application as quickly as possible.
- For POCs that you want to try out without registering your application in an Identity Provider.
- For running and developing locally without internet access.
- For Demo based applications that you want people to download and run - without needing to set up a production identity service first, or without sharing your application id/client secret information. 

### Not for - FakeAuth can not be used in production
- Do not use FakeAuth in a production environment
- FakeAuth will only work on http://localhost/ by default - it's intended to be a development tool.
- You will want to transition to an actual OAuth / Claims provider before you go to Production. Starting with Fake Auth can help you establish and document which claims your application will rely on.

## History
### `version 3.0.0`
- Updated to .NET `9.0` and droppped support for .NET older than `8.0`
- Updated Tests away from `FluentAssertions` to `Shouldy`

### Changes in `version 2.0.0`
- Removed the obsolete extension methods from `version 1.2.0`. Must use `AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth()` methods now.
- Fixed typo in the `HttpClientExtensions` extension class from `SetFakeAuthClaimns` to `SetFakeAuthClaims`
- **New Feature:**  We added a new `AllowedHosts` property to the `FakeAuthOptions` class. Previously, only localhost testing was supported, with `2.0.0` and forward, specific hosts can be configured to support more testing scenarios.
 

### Version 1.2.0
Prior to `version 1.2.0` only `services.UseFakeAuth()` was supported. This is considered obsolete, and will be dropped in version 2.0.0 moving forward.

Starting with `version 1.2.0 +` please use the `services.AddAuthentication().AddFakeAuth()` extension methods.
This was done to more syntactically align FakeAuth with other authentication mechanisms and idioms.

This history section will be removed (more likely updated) when we get to `2.0.0 +`
